## R programming resources

### Core pathway (start here)

#### R for Data Science (R4DS) — *the main course companion*
- https://r4ds.hadley.nz  
- Best for: students new to programming who need a practical workflow  
- Topics: importing, wrangling, visualization, functions, iteration, reporting

#### Hands-On Programming with R — *gentle intro to programming concepts*
- https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/  
- Best for: understanding objects, vectors, functions, and control flow

---

### R for epidemiology and health research

#### The Epidemiologist’s R Handbook — *applied epi/public health workflows*
- https://epirhandbook.com  
- Best for: health-focused examples and “how to do the thing” guidance  
- Great for: descriptive epi, cleaning, regression workflows, reporting

#### R4DS Online Learning Community — *guided practice + peer support*
- https://rfordatasci.com  
- Best for: structured learning, exercises, accountability

---

### Working with larger datasets (scaling up)

#### Efficient R Programming — *performance and memory awareness*
- https://csgillespie.github.io/efficientR/  
- Best for: moving beyond toy datasets; faster, cleaner code

:::callout-tip
### Practical “large data” mindset (for health admin datasets)
- Read only the columns you need  
- Use joins carefully (check row counts before/after)  
- Summarize early; avoid duplicating huge objects  
- Learn to profile slow steps (later in the term)
:::

---

### Reproducible reporting (required skill for health research)

#### R Markdown: The Definitive Guide
- https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/  
- Best for: transparent, reproducible analyses

#### Quarto Guide (Posit)
- https://quarto.org/docs/guide/  
- Best for: reports, slide decks, websites, and publishing course work

---

## SAS programming resources

### Core pathway (start here)

#### SAS Documentation (official)
- https://documentation.sas.com  
- Best for: authoritative reference on DATA step and PROC basics  
- Use for: `DATA` step, `PROC SORT`, `PROC FREQ`, `PROC MEANS`, `PROC SQL`

#### SAS for Students (Academic / Skill Builder landing)
- https://www.sas.com/en_ca/learn/academic-programs/students.html  
- Best for: student learning pathways and getting access via academic programs (availability varies)

---

### SAS for applied statistics (health-relevant examples)

#### UCLA IDRE SAS resources (excellent applied tutorials)
- https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/sas/  
- Best for: clear explanations + worked examples  
- Great for: regression, categorical data, data management patterns

---

### SAS + large datasets (real-world patterns)

#### SAS Global Forum proceedings (conference papers)
- https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum.html  
- Best for: practical approaches to large tables, optimization, reporting

#### Lex Jansen (searchable SAS conference paper archive)
- https://www.lexjansen.com  
- Best for: finding “how do I do X in SAS?” by use case (including health/claims-style problems)

---

## SQL and relational thinking (essential for both R and SAS)

### Mode SQL Tutorial (beginner-friendly)
- https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/  
- Best for: joins, grouping, filtering, window functions fundamentals  
- Why it matters: most health administrative data live in **relational schemas** (multiple tables)

:::callout-note
### Minimum SQL you should learn early
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`  
- `INNER JOIN` vs `LEFT JOIN`  
- Counting rows before/after a join (to avoid accidental duplication)
